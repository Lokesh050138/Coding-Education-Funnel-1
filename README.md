## Coding Education Funnel - HTML File

This repository contains `CodingEducationFunnel.html`, an HTML file designed to display a structured learning pathway for coding education using a funnel-style layout. This educational tool utilizes Bootstrap for responsive design and modern hover effects to create an engaging user experience.

### Features

- **Bootstrap Integration**: The file integrates Bootstrap 5 for easy and responsive layout design. Bootstrap's grid system and utilities ensure the content is well-structured and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

- **Interactive Funnel Stages**: The page displays five distinct stages of a coding education journey:
  1. **Introduction to Coding**: Covers the basics of coding, including programming languages and environments.
  2. **Basic Programming**: Introduces fundamental programming concepts such as variables, loops, and conditional statements.
  3. **Advanced Topics**: Explores more complex topics, including data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.
  4. **Projects and Assignments**: Encourages the application of learned skills through real-world projects and assignments.
  5. **Certification and Job Placement**: Focuses on earning certifications and provides assistance with job placement in the tech industry.

- **Hover Effects and Transformations**: Each funnel stage card features hover effects that slightly scale up the card and add a 3D rotation effect, along with an enhanced shadow. This creates a visually dynamic experience as users explore different stages.

- **Visual Enhancements**: The funnel design includes images for each stage to visually represent the learning process. Subtle animations, like scale and rotation, are applied to the cards on hover to engage users and make the information more accessible.

- **Connector Lines**: Between each stage, a vertical line connects the stages, visually guiding the user through the educational journey and reinforcing the funnel concept.

- **Clean and Modern Aesthetics**: The design uses a clean white background with soft shadows and rounded corners to maintain a modern, professional appearance. The overall aesthetic is minimalistic yet effective, focusing on delivering content clearly and engagingly.

### Usage
